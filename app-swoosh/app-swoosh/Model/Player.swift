//Whenever creating a simple data or model file, it's ok to use a blank Swift file
//No need to load a CocoaTouch file with UIKit

//Struct vs Class
//**** Data should be put into a Struct or Class, NEVER pass multiple variables between VCs

//Use a struct whenever possible: default Swift int-types and strings, etc
//Use a Class for custom things that need to be implemented: custom Classes that hold other classes, for example
//Struct is a value-type and can be copied over directly, and is faster than a Class
//Value-type each instance keeps a unique copy of its data
//Class is a reference-type stored in memory with a shared, mutable state
//Reference-type instances share a single copy of the data

struct Player {
    var desiredLeague: String!
    var selectedSkillLevel: String!
    //Changed String? to String! because this app REQUIRES data in these variables
    
}
